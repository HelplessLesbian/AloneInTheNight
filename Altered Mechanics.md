# Stress

Stress is now *Frag* - as you do inadvisable things with time travel, it causes distortions in your personal timeline. 

If it reaches max, you pick up a *Paradox* that makes life difficult for you.

To reduce *Frag*, you need to find some way to *reconcile* it. This has a few forms:
* Diligently working to provide a full cause and effect for everything you did, working as a time janitor.
* Changing yourself significantly enough that the paradox isn’t able to latch on to you any more.
* Reverting to an earlier version of you.
* Letting the paradox manifest in limited quantities and dealing with the consequences.
* Investing in better and better time machines that take care of the paradox for you.

# Heat
Heat is replaced with Divergence: as you make waves in the time stream, it starts to shift away from what you are familiar with. The higher Divergence is, the weirder you are to everyday inhabitants of the timeline. High enough, and you essentially come under fire from the timeline’s immune system.
