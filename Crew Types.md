# Hedonists
Thieves and tourists who travel around the time stream finding luxuries and taking them back home.

# Eventuals
Representatives of a power at the end of time, working to preserve the timeline so that their bosses continue to eventually exist.

# Chronoclasts
Revolutionaries who want to utterly alter the time stream, working to bend it towards their intended outcome.

# Inter-Era Smugglers
Whether it’s selling high-powered plasma rifles to a 17th century monarch or lifting pre-grave robbing a priceless artifact for a 24th century executive’s private collection, moving goods across temporal boundaries is as profitable as it is illegal: extremely.

# Adjusters
Changing the flow of history in small ways can pay big dividends. Adjusters take contracts to produce a specific outcome in a specific era and try to make the smallest possible changes to past to produce it.
