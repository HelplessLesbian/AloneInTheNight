Stress is now *Frag* - as you do inadvisable things with time travel, it causes distortions in your personal timeline. 

If it reaches max, you pick up a *Paradox* that makes life difficult for you.

To reduce *Frag*, you need to find some way to *reconcile* it. This has a few forms:
* Diligently working to provide a full cause and effect for everything you did, working as a time janitor.
* Changing yourself significantly enough that the paradox isnâ€™t able to latch on to you any more.
* Reverting to an earlier version of you.
* Letting the paradox manifest in limited quantities and dealing with the consequences.
* Investing in better and better time machines that take care of the paradox for you.
