Stress is now *Frag* - as you do inadvisable things with time travel, it causes distortions in your personal timeline. 

If it reaches max, you pick up a *Paradox* that makes life difficult for you.

To reduce *Frag*, you need to find some way to *reconcile* it. This has a few forms:
* Diligently working to provide a full cause and effect for everything you did, working as a time janitor.
* Changing yourself significantly enough that the paradox isnâ€™t able to latch on to you any more.
* Reverting to an earlier version of you.
* Letting the paradox manifest in limited quantities and dealing with the consequences.
* Investing in better and better time machines that take care of the paradox for you.

Some of the things done to push yourself won't neccessarily involve time travel, right? Maybe Frag is a combination of the actual distruption wreaked on your personal timeline and the mental strain involved with being a person who routinely jumps around in time, which the human brain is *definately* not designed to do. I think the vices system from the original Blades adds a lot to character's individual characterization so it'd be nice to still have that element of a personal and unique thing players do to reconcile Frag.
