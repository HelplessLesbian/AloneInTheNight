# Seer
Overexposure to the timestream has given you an intuitive understanding of the warp and weft of history. You can sense which actions will create the most disruption, glimpse hundreds of thousands of possible futures, even anticipate the path of a bullet as it's being fired. These abilities shoudl be used carefully, however, lest overwhelming visions of potential futures leave you insensate to the present.

# Reenactor
Years of pouring over historical texts alone and reenacting famous moments with your friends have given you an encyclopedic knowledge of history and a keen eye for small details. With your expertise (and maybe a touch of 36th century universal translation tech) you can blend seamlessly into any era you choose, and hopefully keep the rest of your squad (who can't even be bothered to use period-accurate buttons on their coats!) from standing out, too.

# Hopper
There's very few problems that can't be solved with a quick dip into the timestream. Locked door? Wasn't there 300 years ago. Staring down a hired killer? Take a quick trip to their childhood and convince them to take up painting instead. Sure, it can have unintended consequences, but it's just little changes- nobody will notice. Be careful about how much you jump around, though-- a misstep could get you stuck in the paleolithic, or worse: nowhen at all.
