List character ideas here.

# Seer
Overexposure to the timestream has given you an intuitive understanding of the warp and weft of history. You can sense which actions will create the most disruption, glimpse hundreds of thousands of possible futures, even anticipate the path of a bullet as it's being fired. These abilities shoudl be used carefully, however, lest overwhelming visions of potential futures leave you insensate to the present.

# Reenactor

Years of pouring over historical texts alone and reenacting famous moments with your friends have given you an encyclopedic knowledge of history and a keen eye for small details. With your expertise (and maybe a touch of 36th century universal translation tech) you can blend seamlessly into any era you choose, and hopefully keep the rest of your squad (who can't even be bothered to use period-accurate buttons on their coats!) from standing out, too.

# Primal
The simpler, the better. You're able to find useful tools in any situation, no matter how basic.

# TIME GHOST
Advanced playbook: taken after you take too many paradoxes.
You still look normal but you feel off, like you shouldn't still exist in the space people see you in.
