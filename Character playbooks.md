# Seer
Overexposure to the timestream has given you an intuitive understanding of the warp and weft of history. You can sense which actions will create the most disruption, glimpse hundreds of thousands of possible futures, even anticipate the path of a bullet as it's being fired. These abilities shoudl be used carefully, however, lest overwhelming visions of potential futures leave you insensate to the present.

# Reenactor

Years of pouring over historical texts alone and reenacting famous moments with your friends have given you an encyclopedic knowledge of history and a keen eye for small details. With your expertise (and maybe a touch of 36th century universal translation tech) you can blend seamlessly into any era you choose, and hopefully keep the rest of your squad (who can't even be bothered to use period-accurate buttons on their coats!) from standing out, too.
