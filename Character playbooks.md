List character ideas here.

# Seer
Overexposure to the timestream has given you an intuitive understanding of the warp and weft of history. You can sense which actions will create the most disruption, glimpse hundreds of thousands of possible futures, even anticipate the path of a bullet as it's being fired. These abilities shoudl be used carefully, however, lest overwhelming visions of potential futures leave you insensate to the present.

# Reenactor

Years of pouring over historical texts alone and reenacting famous moments with your friends have given you an encyclopedic knowledge of history and a keen eye for small details. With your expertise (and maybe a touch of 36th century universal translation tech) you can blend seamlessly into any era you choose, and hopefully keep the rest of your squad (who can't even be bothered to use period-accurate buttons on their coats!) from standing out, too.

# Deviser
Time travel is a tricky concept to conceptualize into a science but you're pretty sure you've got it down. You know the principles of time travel and how to translate it from theory to reality. Basically, you maintain time travel machines and make sure everyone's cobbled-together future tech works no matter the time period. You have a knack for cannibalizing any tech to keep your devises working wherever you are because someone has to make sure everyone can actually travel.

# Wound
Anyone who partakes in time travel is daring at heart, flouting the normal laws of physics to traverse all of time and space. But sometimes, one just gets too close to the sun. If you take on too much Paradox, you have the option to not succumb and instead remain in existence. You become a walking wound in the timeline, a split on the skin of reality. This allows you access to powers beyond what a normal time traveller possess but beware: the more you flout reality, the more your true nature creeps to the surface.
